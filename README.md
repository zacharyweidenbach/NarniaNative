# Narnia
fashion social media

Synopsis

- Project Narnia is a social media platfrom to encourage and assist in the creation of user generated content for the fashion space. Having basic social platform functionality (likes, shares, comments, etc) allows users to easily share their outfits and get feedback on their styling. With functionality like personal wardrobes it allow users to upload thier personal wardrobe into the application and design outfits to wear with out having to pull anything out of the closet or try it on. Tying into Amazon's Product Advertising API allows us to make a seemless easy to use 

Motivation

- The motivation for Project Narnia is vast and diverse. One influencing factor is that the fashion industry seems beyond the reach of most as it exists at the moment. From stylist to designer there is a large barrier to entry. One of Project Narnia's aim is to break that, allowing anyone to be a stylist and designer with ease; and all from the comfort of their couch. Another influencer is that it's currently rather difficult to buy clothes for others. It's challenging to know what they already have, what they could use/what would go well with items they already own and what would fit. We aim to solve this.
